# README

Welcome to the Hikari Project - Ruby on Rails version.

It lets you publish basics about stories, lets you follow other people's work, and comment on their postings.

To run this project, clone this repo, run `bundle install`, then `bin/rails db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
`, and then `rails s`.

It should be up and running on the localhost:3000 if you're in the terminal (necessary for the FB login).

Currently using the gem ruby '2.7.0', ActiveRecord Migration is Version 5.2
NOTE: Omniauth currently not working due to needing reauthorization on FB Developer (TODO)
Dependent on Rails, omniauth, bcrypt, and rack. See the Gemfile for more details.
